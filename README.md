Calculate key operating parameters for AOCS using mathematical models and software packages 
based on fundamental scientific principles, assessing the effect of changing these on the system 
performance. 
2. Simulate and design AOCS systems and components. 
3. Extract pertinent data from appropriate sources and consider relevant industrial and commercial 
constraints in the design of AOCS systems.
